## Commands & Keybindings

This extension provides several useful commands to enhance your development workflow:

### üìã Copy Opened Files Path

**Command**: `VSCode MCP Bridge: Copy Opened Files Path`

Collects all currently opened file paths with dual output modes:
- **Copy to clipboard** (default): Copies paths for external use
- **Send to terminal**: Use `isSendToActiveTerminal: true` parameter to send directly to active terminal

Smart path handling:
- Uses relative paths when files are within workspace
- Falls back to absolute paths for files outside workspace  
- Automatically filters out non-file URIs (like untitled documents)
- Sorts paths alphabetically

### üìù Temp Edit to Terminal

**Command**: `VSCode MCP Bridge: Temp Edit to Terminal`  
**Shortcut**: `Cmd+K Cmd+E`

Opens a temporary markdown file for quick editing. When you close the file:
- Content is automatically sent to the active terminal
- Temporary files are cleaned up automatically
- Empty content is ignored

Perfect for drafting commands, prompts, or quick notes to send to terminal.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Sleep

**Command**: `VSCode MCP Bridge: Sleep`

Utility command that pauses execution for a specified duration (in seconds). Designed for use in VSCode shortcuts.json `runCommands` sequences to add delays between multiple commands.
